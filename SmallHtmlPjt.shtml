            <h4>Subjects of study</h4>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility--as long as the subjects
            fall<br>
            somewhere in the real of science and technolohy. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
            just <br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
            intrigued<br>
            by are as follows, in oreder of priority:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
                    Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Measuring the effect on performance of <em>funk</em>bassplayers at temperatures excceeding 30°C
                    (86℉),when the<br>
                    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Html</em> and <em>CSS</em> construct for representing musical scores.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
                the<br>
                research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
                Thanks.</p>

                Yes , you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I<em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To
                answer your question,<br>
                my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            <p>
            <dl>
                <!--이부분을 못했다 dl dt dd의 사용법 기억하즈아!-->
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>
                    A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village
                    would dance
                    around<<br>
                    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be"fruitful".
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Icelandic brownian shuffle
                </dt>
                <dd>
                Before the Icelanders develped fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
                which<br>
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
                imperceptably<br>
                tiny, very rapid mobements. One of my fellow students use to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
                modern styles such as <em>Twerking</em>.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Arctic robot dance
                </dt>
                <dd>
                An intersting example of historic misinformation, English exploerers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
                discovered a new dance style characterised by"robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
                inhabitants<br>
                of <em>Northern Alaska</em> and <em>Canada</em>. Later on however it was discovered that they were just
                moving like this<br>
                because they were really cold.
